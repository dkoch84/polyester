Polyester is a document authoring language that occupies an interesting niche in the markup landscape. It combines the readability of **Markdown** with the structured power of **LaTeX**, sitting alongside **Typst** as a modern alternative for document creation.

## Core Philosophy

Polyester uses a `/command` syntax that's intuitive and readable. Unlike LaTeX's backslash escapes or Typst's hash-based functions, Polyester commands feel more like CLI invocations—familiar territory for developers.

## Key Characteristics

### Hybrid Content Model

- Commands start with `/` at the beginning of a line
- Plain Markdown flows naturally between commands
- No need to wrap everything in special syntax

### Flexible Arguments

/code polyester {
/command positional "quoted arg" --flag value { block content }
}

Positional args, quoted strings, flags, and blocks all coexist cleanly.

### Pipe Transforms

/code polyester {
/text "hello" | bold | color red
}

This functional chaining is unique—neither Markdown, LaTeX, nor Typst have this pattern built-in.

### Block Nesting

Curly braces contain nested content, enabling structured layouts without escaping into a different mode.

## Compared to Neighbors

/table --header --bordered {
Feature | Markdown | LaTeX | Typst | Polyester
Learning curve | Low | High | Medium | Low
Layout control | Minimal | Full | Full | Full
Syntax style | Implicit | `\command{}` | `#command()` | `/command {}`
Pipes/transforms | No | No | Limited | Yes
CSS-like styling | No | No | Partial | Yes
}

## Strengths

- **Layout primitives**: Grid, columns, regions with CSS-like properties (`--gap`, `--bg`, `--padding`)
- **Component library**: Cards, heroes, buttons—web-inspired but document-focused
- **Multiple outputs**: HTML and PDF from the same source
- **Readable source**: Someone unfamiliar can parse a `.poly` file easily

Polyester feels designed for people who want LaTeX's power, Markdown's simplicity, and modern web-style layouts without learning three different systems.
